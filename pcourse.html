        Polytechnic courses are diploma or vocational courses that focus on
        delivering technological education. Generally, polytechnic courses are a
        three-year programme, after completion of which candidates obtain a
        diploma certificate. Polytechnic courses also help students start their
        careers by acquiring a good job at a reputed company. Many top
        engineering institutions offer diploma courses in several B.tech
        specialisations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Many institutes offer polytechnic diploma courses in various fields,
        including engineering. Most institutes conduct polytechnic courses
        primarily in civil, mechanical, electrical, and newly emerging
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Polytechnic courses are diplomas in technical courses which can serve as
        a precursor to undergraduate engineering programs such as
        <b>B.Tech</b>. or <b> B.E</b>. (Bachelor of Engineering). Candidates
        joining a polytechnic diploma course can join B.E. or B.Tech. course via
        lateral entry. Polytechnic courses are helpful in establishing basics
        and providing insight into engineering and its subjects.
      </p>

        Diploma courses in India are pursued after passing 10th or 12th as per
        the requirements of course.Diploma in various streams offer job
        oppurtunities in various fields.
