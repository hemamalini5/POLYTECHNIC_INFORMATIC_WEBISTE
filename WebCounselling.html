      <br />
      <p>

        one of the designated banks and obtain a receipt. After that candidate
        with allotment order and Fee receipts have to report at the respective

        challan will have no claim on the admission into polytechnics.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If Candidate fails to report for admission at the allotted polytechnic
        by the dates stipulated, the allotment stands cancelled and candidate
        will have no claim for further allotment of seats. Calling for
        counseling does not guarantee a seat, as more number of candidates than
        the seats available, will be called for. The Convenor is fully empowered
        to disqualify a candidate seeking admission if Admission Officer is not
        satisfied with the documents produced by the Candidate. The decision of
        Convenor is final in matters of granting seat / rejecting seat to a
        candidate called for counseling.

      <p>
        The candidate shall attend the counseling at their own cost and if
        necessary, they may have to stay a day more at the station of Admission
        Camp as advised by the Admission Officer. The selection of
        ST/SC/BC/CAP/PH/NCC/SPORTS candidates is subject to the clearance to be
        given by the respective departments during the counseling. Convener is
        not responsible for the delay in clearance in respect of doubtful caste
        cases.
