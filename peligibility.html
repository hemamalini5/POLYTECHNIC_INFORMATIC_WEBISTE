      <p>
        Admission to this course is selective and is done by both merit and
        entrance tests. However, some institutions might take an interview
        before giving admission. Students Scanned with CamScanner will get
        admission in the second year of the BTech course through lateral
        entry. This is possible when a student completes a Diploma in
        Engineering.
